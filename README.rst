      - Flash WLED to the ESP device: https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/wiki/Install-WLED-binary
      - Ensure all WLED devices are powered on, and connected to your Wi-Fi.
      - Test you can access the WLED web interface from your PC. If so, then you're good to go!

#. **Install LedFx.**
      - After you have WLED installed on your ESP device, download: `LedFx.exe`_ and install LedFx.
      - For Mac and Linux, see the `installation documentation`_ or `LedFx Guide`_.

#. **Direct computer audio output to LedFx.**
