The dockerimage uses uv as the package manager to install dependencies and uses uv pip install to install LedFx itself.
The dockerimage also has pulseaudio server running as the ledfx user with UID:GID=1000:1000
The pulseaudio socket is exposed without authentication and located at /home/ledfx/.config/pulse/pulseaudio.socket
Please bear with the rudimentary effort as this is not my area of expertise, but I wished for a LedFx docker image released from LedFx developers during their package release. Quite a few docker images are available on dockerhub and they have been the source of knowhow for this image.
Many thanks to https://hub.docker.com/r/ssankur/ledfx for ledfx docker part and https://github.com/jessfraz for pulseaudio part and some ChatGPT assistance.
