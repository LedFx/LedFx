      - Follow the WLED guide to connect the LED strip and ESP together: https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/wiki.
      - Flash WLED to the ESP device: https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/wiki/Install-WLED-binary
      - Ensure all WLED devices are powered on, and connected to your Wi-Fi.
      - Test you can access the WLED web interface from your PC. If so, then you're good to go!

2. **Install LedFx.**
      - After you have WLED installed on your ESP device, download: [LedFx.exe](https://ledfx.app/download/) and install LedFx.
      - For Mac and Linux, see the [installation documentation](https://ledfx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html) or [LedFx Guide](https://ledfx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

3. **Direct computer audio output to LedFx.**
      - Follow guide, [How to: Enable Stereo Mix in Windows 10](https://thegeekpage.com/stereo-mix/).
      - Alternatively use [Voicemeeter](https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/index.htm). [Voicemeeter tutorial](https://youtu.be/ZXKDzYXS60o?start=27&end=163).
      - More information for [Linux and macOS users here](https://ledfx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/directing_audio.html).
      - Play some music in the background.

4. **Start LedFx.**
      - Your WLED devices should appear in LedFx, automagically configured and ready to go! üéÜüî•
      - If not, on the left hand side, click on Device Management -> `Find WLED devices` button, or `Add Device` to add them manually.
      - If they're still not showing up, make sure they're powered on and properly connected to your WiFi.

5. **Start using effects!**
      - Click on the device, select an effect eg `scroll(Reactive)`, and press `Set effect` button.
      - Your lights should now be reacting realtime to your music! Enjoy the show üåà
