def sawtooth(t, width=1):
    """
    Return a periodic sawtooth or triangle waveform.

    The sawtooth waveform has a period ``2*pi``, rises from -1 to 1 on the
    interval 0 to ``width*2*pi``, then drops from 1 to -1 on the interval
    ``width*2*pi`` to ``2*pi``. `width` must be in the interval [0, 1].

    Note that this is not band-limited.  It produces an infinite number
    of harmonics, which are aliased back and forth across the frequency
    spectrum.

    Parameters
    ----------
    t : array_like
        Time.
    width : array_like, optional
        Width of the rising ramp as a proportion of the total cycle.
        Default is 1, producing a rising ramp, while 0 produces a falling
        ramp.  `width` = 0.5 produces a triangle wave.
        If an array, causes wave shape to change over time, and must be the
        same length as t.

    Returns
    -------
    y : ndarray
        Output array containing the sawtooth waveform.

    Examples
    --------
    A 5 Hz waveform sampled at 500 Hz for 1 second:

    >>> from scipy import signal
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> t = np.linspace(0, 1, 500)
    >>> plt.plot(t, signal.sawtooth(2 * np.pi * 5 * t))
