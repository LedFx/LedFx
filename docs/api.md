# REST API

The REST APIs are undergoing active development, so some of the below
APIs may change in time. APIs marked as (upcoming) are yet to be added.

## /api/info

Information about LedFx

**GET**

Returns basic information about the LedFx instance as JSON

``` json
{
  "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8888",
  "name": "LedFx",
  "version": "0.3.0"
}
```

## /api/config

Endpoint for managing LedFx Configuration

**GET**

Returns the current configuration for LedFx as JSON A GET with no
request body will return LedFx\'s full configuration.

You may instead ask for any number of the config keys:

-   *host*
-   *port*
-   *port_s*
-   *dev_mode*
-   *configuration_version*
-   *scan_on_startup*
-   *visualisation_fps*
-   *visualisation_maxlen*
-   *audio*
-   *melbanks*
-   *wled_preferences*
-   *devices*
-   *virtuals*
-   *integrations*
-   *scenes*
-   *user_presets*
-   *ledfx_presets*
-   *flush_on_deactivate*

example: Get LedFx audio configuration

``` json
"audio"
```

example: Get LedFx audio, devices, and scenes configuration

``` json
["audio", "devices", "scenes"]
```

**PUT**

Updates LedFx configuration with any permitted keys. LedFx will handle
the update and restart if necessary. Generally, updating any core config
key will trigger a restart.

example:

``` json
{
  "audio": {
    "min_volume": 0.3
  },
  "dev_mode": true,
  "visualisation_fps": 50,
  "port": 8080
}
```

**POST**

Set full LedFx config. You must provide a full, valid config. LedFx will
restart to apply the config. To simply update a part of the config, use
PUT

**DELETE**

Resets LedFx\'s config to default values and restarts.

*Warning* This will irreversibly delete all your devices, settings, etc.

## /api/log

LedFx Logging

**GET**

Opens a websocket connection through which realtime LedFx logging info
will be sent.

## /api/schema/

LedFx Schema Api

**GET /api/schema/**

Get JSON schemas specifically defining the kind of data LedFx\'s API
expects. A GET with no request body will return all of LedFx\'s schemas
LedFx uses schemas to validate the following:

-   *devices*
-   *effects*
-   *integrations*
-   *virtuals*
-   *audio*
-   *melbanks*
-   *wled_preferences*

Like with the /api/config endpoint, you may instead ask for spefific
schemas

example: Get LedFx audio schema

``` json
"audio"
```

example: Get LedFx devices and effects schema

``` json
["devices", "effects"]
```

## /api/schema/\<schema_type\>

-   *effects*: Returns all the valid schemas for an LedFx effect
-   *integrations*: Returns all the integrations registered with LedFx

## /api/devices

Query and manage devices connected to LedFx

**GET**

Get configuration of all devices

**POST**

Adds a new device to LedFx based on the provided JSON configuration

## /api/devices/\<device_id\>

Query and manage a specific device with the matching *device_id* as JSON

**GET**

Returns information about the device

**PUT**

Modifies the information pertaining to the device and returns the new
device as JSON

**DELETE**

## /api/find_devices

Find and add all WLED devices on the LAN.

**POST**

For unregisted WLED devices, reads config direct from WLED remote device
Will default the remote protocol to DDP, unless WLED device build is
prior to DDP support, in which case it will default to UDP If device
name has not been over ridden in WLED itself, then name will be
generated from WLED-\<6 digits of MAC Address\> Additionally ledfx
virtuals will be created for all virtuals defined on the WLED device
itself

Returns success as this is only a trigger action, device registration is
handled by the back end

## /api/find_launchpad

**GET**

Returns the name of the first Launchpad device discovered on the system

example:

``` json
{
    "status": "success",
    "device": "Launchpad X"

## /api/effects

Query and manage all effects

**GET**

Returns all the effects currently created in LedFx as JSON

**POST (upcoming)**

Create a new Effect based on the provided JSON configuration

## /api/effects/\<effect_id\>

Query and manage a specific effect with the matching *effect_id* as JSON

**GET**

Returns information about the effect

**PUT (upcoming)**

Modifies the configuration of the effect and returns the new
configuration as JSON

**DELETE (upcoming)**

Deletes the effect with the matching *effect_id*.

## /api/virtuals

Query and manage virtuals connected to LedFx

**GET**

Get configuration of all virtuals

**POST**

Adds a new virtual to LedFx based on the provided JSON configuration

## /api/virtuals/\<virtual_id\>

Query and manage a specific virtual with the matching *virtual_id* as
JSON

**GET**

Returns information about the virtual

**PUT**

Set a virtual to active or inactive. Must evaluate to True or False with
python\'s bool() (eg, true, 1, ..)

example:

``` json
{
  "active": false
}
```

**POST**

Update a virtual\'s segments configuration. Format is a list of lists in
segment order.

\[\[id, start, end, invert\], \...\]

id: valid device id start: first pixel on the device for this segment
end: last pixel on the device for this segment (inclusive) invert:
invert this segment when it is mapped onto the device

example:

``` json
{
  "segments": [
      ["my_device", 0, 49, false],
      ["my_other_device", 0, 99, false],
      ["my_device", 50, 99, false]
  ]
}
```

This would end up with a virtual appearing on the devices as so:

```
[---first 50px of effect---][---last 50px of effect---] [---------------middle 100px of effect----------------]
[-------------------my_device (100px)-----------------] [---------------my_other_device (100px)---------------]
```

another example:

``` json
{
  "segments": [
      ["my_device", 0, 9, false],
      ["my_device", 20, 79, false],
      ["my_device", 90, 99, false]
  ]
}
```

This would end up with a virtual appearing on the devices as so:

```
[ 10px ]    [------ 60px of effect ------]     [ 10px ]
[-------------------my_device (100px)-----------------]
```

**DELETE**

Deletes a virtual with the matching *virtual_id*

## /api/virtuals/{virtual_id}/effects

**DELETE**

Clear the active effect of a virtual

### Fallback effects

/api/virtuals/{virtual_id}/effects has been extended for PUT and POST
with an optional fallback parameter

\"fallback\": (true / false / seconds)

If true ( 300 seconds ) or a value in float seconds, the current running
effect on the virtual will be set as the fallback.

Fallback is auto triggered by the completed scoll of texter2d with side
scroll or the timer expiring

This is intended for use cases such as temporarily displaying a track
name before returning to the prior effect configuration.

Additionally a running temporary effect can be cancelled by triggering
the fallback via a call to /api/virtuals/{virtual_id}/fallback

This can be used for interactive scenarios such as releasing a button
that triggered the temporary effect.

## /api/virtuals/{virtual_id}/fallback

**GET**

Cancel the temporary effect on virtual_id and force the fallback to
trigger, removes any fallback timers

Use for a button release to clear the fallback effect cycle

## /api/virtuals/{virtual_id}/effects/delete

**POST**

Endpoint to remove a specific effect type from the virtual stored
configurations

``` json
{
    "type": "energy2"
}
```

The effect contained in the param provided will be removed from the
configuration for the virtual.

If that effect type is the active effect on the virtual, the active
effect will also be cleared.

If the provide effect type is not present, no change will occur, and a
success message will be returned.

## /api/virtuals/\<virtual_id\>/presets

Endpoint linking virtuals to effect presets (pre-configured effect
configs) with the matching *virtual_id* as JSON

**GET**

Get preset effect configs for active effect of a virtual

**PUT**

exisiting oneshot will be cleared

A bare call to onsshot will result in a hard disable of any existing
oneshot that is executing

``` json
{
    "tool":"oneshot",
    "color":"white",
    "ramp":10,

# WebSocket API

In addition to the REST APIs LedFx has a WebSocket API for streaming
realtime data. The primary use for this is for things like effect
visualizations in the frontend.

Will document this further once it is more well defined. The general
structure will be event registration based.
