#. Install poetry using PowerShell:

   .. code:: console

    $ (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | py -

#. Clone the main branch from the LedFx Github repository:

   .. code:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/LedFx/LedFx.git


#. Install LedFx and its requirements using poetry:

   .. code:: console

    $ cd LedFx
    $ poetry install

#. This will let you run LedFx directly from the cloned repository via:

   .. code:: console

    $ ledfx --open-ui

Linux
-------
.. note::

    This assumes an apt based system such as ubuntu.
    If your system uses another package manager you should be able use it to get the required packages.

..    Frontend Development
.. --------------------------

.. Building the LedFx frontend is different from how the core backend is built. The frontend is based on React.js and thus
.. uses NPM as the core package management.

.. .. note:: LedFx will need to be running in development mode for everything to work. To enable development mode,
..           open the ``config.json`` file in the ``.ledfx`` folder and set ``dev_mode: true``)

.. .. _linux-frontend:

.. Linux
.. -------

.. .. note:: The following instructions assume you have already followed the steps above to :ref:`install the LedFx dev environment <linux-dev>`

.. To get started, first install npm and all the requirements:

.. **1.** Start in the LedFx repo directory:

.. .. code:: console

..     $ pip install yarn
..     $ cd frontend
..     $ yarn

.. The easiest way to test and validate your changes is to run a watcher that will automatically rebuild as you save and then
.. just leave LedFx running in a separate command window.

.. **2.** Start LedFx in development mode and start the watcher:

.. .. code:: console

..     $ python3 ledfx
..     $ yarn start

.. At that point any change you make to the frontend will be recompiled and after a browser refresh LedFx will pick up the
.. new files. After development and testing you will need to run a full build to generate the appropriate distribution files
.. prior to submitting any changes.

.. **3.** When you are finished with your changes, build the frontend:

.. .. code:: console

..     $ yarn build

.. .. _macos-frontend:

.. macOS
.. -------

.. .. note:: The following instructions assume you have already followed the steps above to :ref:`install the LedFx dev environment <macos-dev>`

.. **1.** Install nodejs and NPM requirements using `homebrew`_:

.. .. code:: console

..     $ brew install nodejs
..     $ brew install yarn
..     $ cd ~/frontend
..     $ yarn

.. **2.** Start LedFx in developer mode and start the NPM watcher:

.. .. code:: console

..     $ python3 ledfx
..     $ yarn start

.. **3.** When you are finished with your changes, build the frontend:

.. .. code:: console

..     $ yarn build
