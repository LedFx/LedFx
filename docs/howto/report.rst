How to: Report an issue
=======================

This page is intended to give guidance on reporting an issue to the ledfx community.

If you are having an issue, then you probably want to just get answers, and all this reading and stuff is overhead.

Just spamming cryptic woe into the discord general channel, will quickly tire our own front office drones.

The community needs clues on how to help.

What is obvious to you, is likely unknown to others, your setup and usage likely close to unique, so to give the code droids, kept in the darkest dungeons of castle ledfx, a chance, please work through this guide, and try to provide as much infomration as you can upfront.

If a code droid is successful, sometimes we might even recharge their batteries a little above critical and turn the lights on in their cell for a short time. Please, think of the code droids...

A well structured issue report is far more likely to get a quick and accurate response than a vague chain of tech babble. Invest in solving your problems so that the community can invest in helping you.

Discord or Github?
------------------

Whatever works for you. Github is closer to the coal face, but discord is more immediate. If you are not sure, try discord first. Some people don't want to be in discord, and thats fine, then use github.

If you are using `Discord <https://discord.gg/4hQdAw5H5T>`_, PLEASE use the `#help_and_support <https://discord.gg/enRRD8XJ>`_ channel. Create a post in there, the threading model is far more discoverable for future users to follow your breadcrumbs to solution. It keeps the conversation focused and will lead to a faster solution. Things just get lost in #general over time.

If you are using Github then please raise an issue in `Ledfx issues <https://github.com/LedFx/LedFx/issues>`_

Issue template
--------------

When you open an issue via github, you will automatically get a template to fill in. Please fill in as much as you can.

If you are using discord, then please try to follow the same structure, just hit the copy button here...
