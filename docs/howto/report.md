# How to: Report an issue

This page is intended to give guidance on reporting an issue to the
ledfx community.

If you are having an issue, then you probably want to just get answers,
and all this reading and stuff feels like overhead.

Just spamming cryptic woe into the discord #general channel, will
quickly tire out our front office drones.

The community needs clues on how to help.

What is obvious to you, is likely unknown to others, your setup and
usage likely close to unique, so to give the code droids, kept in the
darkest dungeons of techno-castle ledfx, a chance, please work through
this guide, and try to provide as much information as you can upfront.

If a code droid is successful, sometimes we might even recharge their
batteries a little above critical and turn the lights on in their cell
for a short time. Please, think of the code droids\...

A well structured issue report is far more likely to get a quick and
accurate response than a vague chain of tech babble. Invest in solving
your problems so that the community can invest in helping you.

A screenshot or even a video of your interaction, if you can reproduce
the issue does wonders for the logic circuits of our code droids, well,
reduces the chance of burnout, and we are all out of spare cards.

## Discord or Github?

Whatever works for you. Github is closer to the coal face, but discord
is more immediate. If you are not sure, try discord first. Some people
don\'t want to be in discord, and thats fine, then use github.

If you are using [Discord](https://discord.gg/4hQdAw5H5T), PLEASE use
the [#help_and_support](https://discord.gg/enRRD8XJ) channel. Create a
post in there, the threading model is far more discoverable for future
users to follow your breadcrumbs to solution. It keeps the conversation
focused and will lead to a faster solution. Things just get lost in
#general over time.

If you are using Github then please raise an issue in [Ledfx
issues](https://github.com/LedFx/LedFx/issues)

## Issue template

When you open an issue via github, you will automatically get a template
to fill in. Please fill in as much as you can.

If you are using discord, [Please read this before
posting](https://discord.com/channels/469985374052286474/1142309460946198648)
then please try to follow the same structure, just hit the copy button

Describe the bug A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

- Go to '...'
- Click on '....'
- Scroll down to '....'
- See error

Expected behavior:

  A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

Screenshots:

  If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

Traceback:

  If applicable, add the traceback log that LedFx outputs when it encounters an error.

  Usually starts with "Traceback (most recent call last):"

LedFx Host Information (please complete the following information):

- OS: [e.g. iOS]
- Installation Method: [e.g. Anaconda, Python, Windows EXE, pip]
- LedFx Version: [e.g. 2.0.104 - use ledfx --version to find out]

Additional context:

  Add any other context about the problem here.

  Please add a config.yaml and a ledfx.log as described in the documentation
```

## How to launch with the -vv option

Launching ledfx with the -vv option will give you more verbose output in
the logs, which can be useful for debugging.

If you are launching from the command line, you can add the -vv option
to the command.

Open a terminal and run the following command:

``` bash
.\ledfx -vv --open-ui
```

If you are launching from the desktop shortcut, you can add the -vv
option to the command in the shortcut.

Right click it and select properties, then add -vv to the end of the
target field. In this example we also have \--open-ui which is useful to
get straight to the user interface.

## How to find the config.yaml and ledfx.log

Now you have your logging verbose, and have relauched and reproduced
your issue in ledfx, we need to find the assets and place copies of them
in your issue report.

They live in the .ledfx directory, which is often a hidden directory in
your user home directory.

The exact location is OS dependant.

Examples being, but not limited to, the following locations

Windows:

> ``` console
> C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\.ledfx
> %appdata%\.ledfx
> ```

Linux:

> ``` console
> /home/username/.ledfx
> ~/.ledfx
> ```

MacOS:

> ``` console
> /Users/username/.ledfx
> ~/.ledfx
> ```

The config.yaml and ledfx.log files are the most important files to
include in your issue report.

If you have read this far, the humble code droids thank you, and look
forward to their brief respite from the darkness, should they be able to
solve your problems\...
