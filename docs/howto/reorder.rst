How to: Reorder Device and Virtuals
===================================

It is now possible to set the order of devices and viruals in the device tab to make navigating your devices easier, with a simple drag and drop operation.

Enable Sort Devices by user
---------------------------

First the feature needs to be enabled to override other sort options

This is found under Settings / Devices / Sort Devices by User

Open the Change Order drag and drop bar
---------------------------------------

Once this has been enabled, when in the devices view, we will have a new option under the 3 dot menu in the top right

Selecting Change Order will bump in a drag and drop bar with all devices and virtuals

The Drag and Drop bar
---------------------

All devices and viruals will be in the current display order, an example is below.
