   Installation and Setup
============================

LedFx is a network controller that aims to enable synchronization of multiple lights across a network.
To be able to add your LED strips to LedFx your device needs to be capable of receiving data via one of the supported protocols.
See below for a list of tested ESP8266 firmware that can be used with LedFx.

Here is everything you need to get started with LedFx:

    #. A Computer (or Raspberry Pi) with Python >= 3.9
    #. An E1.31 capable device with addressable LEDs connected

Here is a list of tested ESP8266 firmware that works with LedFx:

    - WLED_ is preferred and has lots of great firmware effects (ESP32/ESP8266)
    - ESPixelStick_ is a great E1.31 based firmware
    - `Scott's Audio Reactive Firmware`_ which inspired this project!

Windows Installation
----------------------

To get started on Windows the easiest option is to `download the latest release <https://download.ledfx.app>`_.

There is no installation required, the application is portable.

Linux Installation
--------------------

To install on Linux first ensure you have at least Python 3.9 installed.

#. Install LedFx and all the dependencies using pipx:

   .. code:: console

    $ python -m pip install ledfx

#. Run LedFx!

   .. code:: console

    $ ledfx

macOS Installation
--------------------

To install on macOS first ensure you have at least Python 3.9 installed.

#. Install LedFx and all the dependencies using `homebrew`_ and pip:

   .. code:: console

    $ brew install portaudio
    $ python3 -m pip install ledfx

#. Alternatively, install LedFx in a `python venv`_:

   .. code:: console

    $ python3 -m venv ~/ledfx-venv
    $ source ~/ledfx-venv/bin/activate
    $ python -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
    $ python -m pip install ledfx

#. Launch LedFx with the ``open-ui`` option to launch the browser:

   .. code:: console

    $ ledfx --open-ui

macOS Installation (Apple Silicon)
----------------------------------------------------------------

To install on macOS (Apple Silicon) first ensure you have at least Python 3.9 installed.

#. Install LedFx and all the dependencies using `homebrew`_ in a `python venv`_:

   .. code:: console

    $ brew install python@3.9
    $ brew install portaudio --HEAD
    $ brew install virtualenv
    $ virtualenv -p python3.9 ~/ledfx-venv
    $ source ~/ledfx-venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install --force-reinstall ledfx


#.  If you get a numpy/aubio error please do the following:

    .. code:: console

    $ pip uninstall numpy aubio
    $ pip install numpy --no-cache-dir
    $ pip install aubio --no-cache-dir

#. Launch LedFx with the ``open-ui`` option to launch the browser:

   .. code:: console

    $ ledfx --open-ui

Raspberry Pi Installation
---------------------------

.. warning::
  This installation method is still in development. Use at your discretion.

.. note::
  To use LedFx on a pi you will need a USB audio card.

Verify you have Python 3.9 or greater by running ``python3 --version``

**1.** Modify /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf:

We need to change the default audio card from the built-in hardware on the pi to the USB audio card in use.

.. code:: console

    $ sudo nano /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf

Look for the following lines and change them accordingly:

FROM:

.. code-block:: shell

    defaults.ctl.card 0
    defaults.pcm.card 0

TO:

.. code-block:: shell

    defaults.ctl.card 1
    defaults.pcm.card 1

**2.** Install LedFx and all the dependencies using our `LedFx Bash Install Script`_:

.. code:: console

    $ curl -sSL https://install.ledfx.app/ | bash
