# Development Setup

## Backend Development

### Common Steps

1. Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version 3.9 or above. 3.12 is the current preferred python release for general development.

2. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/).

3. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
    - We suggest using the standalone installer to make updates easier while uv is rapidly changing


4. Clone the main branch from the LedFx Github repository:

    ```console
    $ git clone https://github.com/LedFx/LedFx.git
    ```

5. Using uv, create a virtual environment, install all dependencies, and launch ledfx:

    ```console
    $ cd LedFx
    $ uv run ledfx
    ```

    uv can be used to launch ledfx at any time against the established venv.

### Windows Specific Steps

Do not install python from the Windows Store - it will not work with these instructions.
::::

1. Install [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022)

    - When asked for Workloads, select "Desktop development with C++"
    - Included:
        - C++ Build Tools core features
        - C++ 2022 Redistributable Update
        - C++ Core desktop features
    - Optional:
        - MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools (vXX,XX)
        - Windows SDK
        - C++ CMake tools for Windows
        - Testing tools core features - Build Tools
        - C++ AddressSanitizer
    - The default install options are appropriate.

2. Reboot

### Linux Specific Steps {#linux-dev}

:::: note
::: title
Note
:::

This assumes an apt based system such as ubuntu. If your system uses another package manager you should be able use it to get the required packages.
::::

1. Within the shell in which you intend to install / build establish the follow build flag to ensure that GCC 14 does not throw errors on pre-exisitng weaknesses in the aubio library during build time.

    ```console
    $ export CFLAGS="-Wno-incompatible-function-pointer-types"
    ```

2. Install system dependencies via `apt install`:

    ```console
    $ sudo apt install libatlas3-base \
          libavformat58 \
          portaudio19-dev \
          pulseaudio \
          cmake \
    ```

### macOS Specific Steps {#macos-dev}

No additional steps required.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Local pytest

There are a collection of system level tests run as a test clamp around the rest api's.

These are run as part of the CI actions when raising a PR and must run clean green before a PR is merged.

To run these local and / or develop more tests

1) Ensure you have local loopback installed, or you may hit failures once audio effects are under test

    ``` console
    $  ledfx-loopback-install
    ```

2) launch the suite of tests with uv which will ensure dependancies are installed


    ``` console
    $ uv run pytest -vv
    ```

## Frontend Development

Building the LedFx frontend is different from how the core backend is
built. The frontend is based on React.js and thus uses pnpm as the core
package management.

The following instructions assume you have already followed the steps
above to <a href="developer.html#backend-development">install the LedFx dev environment</a> and have the backend running. If you have not done so,
please do so before continuing.
::::

:::: note

LedFx will need to be running in development mode for everything to
work. To enable development mode, open the `config.json` file in the
`.ledfx` folder and set `dev_mode: true`
::::

### Windows

**1.** Install Node.js and pnpm:

First, you need to install Node.js. You can download it from [Node.js
official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). After installing
Node.js, you can install pnpm via npm (which is installed with Node.js).

``` console
$ npm install -g pnpm
```

**2.** Navigate to the frontend directory and install the dependencies:

``` console
$ cd frontend
$ pnpm install
```

**3.** Start LedFx in developer mode and start the pnpm watcher:

``` console
$ uv run ledfx
$ pnpm start
```

At this point, any changes you make to the frontend will be recompiled,
and after a browser refresh, LedFx will pick up the new files. After
development and testing, you will need to run a full build to generate
the appropriate distribution files prior to submitting any changes.

**4.** When you are finished with your changes, build the frontend:

``` console
$ pnpm build
```

### Linux

**1.** Install Node.js:

Node.js is a prerequisite for pnpm. You can install it using your
distribution\'s package manager. For Ubuntu, you can use the following
commands:

``` console
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs
```

**2.** Install pnpm:

``` console
$ curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -
```

**3.** Navigate to the frontend directory and install the dependencies:

``` console
$ cd frontend
$ pnpm install
```

The easiest way to test and validate your changes is to run a watcher
that will automatically rebuild as you save and then just leave LedFx
running in a separate command window.

**4.** Start LedFx in development mode and start the watcher:

``` console
$ uv run ledfx
$ pnpm start
```

At that point any change you make to the frontend will be recompiled and
after a browser refresh LedFx will pick up the new files. After
development and testing you will need to run a full build to generate
the appropriate distribution files prior to submitting any changes.

**5.** When you are finished with your changes, build the frontend:

``` console
$ pnpm build
```

### macOS {#macos-frontend}

**1.** Install nodejs and NPM requirements using
[homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation):

``` console
$ brew install nodejs
$ brew install pnpm
$ cd ~/frontend
$ pnpm install
```

**2.** Start LedFx in developer mode and start the NPM watcher:

``` console
$ uv run ledfx
$ pnpm start
```

**3.** When you are finished with your changes, build the frontend:

``` console
$ pnpm build
```

## Document Development

See the [Documents Development](README.md) for more information.

## How it works

Well enough for discussional purposes. This diagram specifically
illustrates audio reactive effects, temporal are similar but have their
own thread loop independant of audio framing.

## Useful Tools

### VSCode extensions

For backend development, vscode is the IDE of choice.

There are many extensions that are of use to developers, including but
not limited to

-   Github Copilot
-   Github Pull Requests
-   autoDocsting
-   GitLens
-   Prettier
-   Pylance
-   Python
-   Python Debugger
-   Tasks
-   Teleplot

### Tasks

A simple extension to run tasks from the vscode taskbar at the bottom of
the window.

[Tasks by
actboy168](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=actboy168.tasks)

Currently only the Build and Open Docs task is exposed. This task will
install dependancies, build the docs and open in your browser, all with
a single click!

![Build and Open Docs, do it!](/_static/howto/taskbar.png)

### Teleplot

Teleplot is a great tool for visualizing data in real time, that can be
the graphing equivalent of print()

It is used during development to quickly graph, and then thrown away, do
not submit teleplot code to the main branch.

General documentation along with rich examples is at [Teleplot
Github](https://github.com/nesnes/teleplot)

A helper Class has been added to the LedFx codebase to make it easier to
use, and is available at ledfx/utils.py

simply import the class and use it as follows

``` python
from ledfx.utils import Teleplot

Teleplot.send(f"my_var_name:{my_var_value}")
```
