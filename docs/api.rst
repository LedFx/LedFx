   REST API
==============

The REST APIs are undergoing active development, so some of the below APIs may change in time.
APIs marked as (upcoming) are yet to be added.

/api/info
===============

Information about LedFx

.. rubric:: GET

Returns basic information about the LedFx instance as JSON

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8888",
      "name": "LedFx",
      "version": "0.3.0"
    }

/api/config
===============

Endpoint for managing LedFx Configuration

.. rubric:: GET

Returns the current configuration for LedFx as JSON
A GET with no request body will return LedFx's full configuration.

You may instead ask for any number of the config keys:

- *host*
- *port*
- *port_s*
- *dev_mode*
- *configuration_version*
- *scan_on_startup*
- *visualisation_fps*
- *visualisation_maxlen*
- *audio*
- *melbanks*
- *wled_preferences*
- *devices*
- *virtuals*
- *integrations*
- *scenes*
- *user_presets*
- *ledfx_presets*

example: Get LedFx audio configuration

.. code-block:: json

    "audio"

example: Get LedFx audio, devices, and scenes configuration

.. code-block:: json

    ["audio", "devices", "scenes"]

.. rubric:: PUT

Updates LedFx configuration with any permitted keys.
LedFx will handle the update and restart if necessary.
Generally, updating any core config key will trigger a restart.

example:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "audio": {
        "min_volume": 0.3
      },
      "dev_mode": true,
      "visualisation_fps": 50,
      "port": 8080
    }

.. rubric:: POST

Set full LedFx config. You must provide a full, valid config.
LedFx will restart to apply the config.
To simply update a part of the config, use PUT

.. rubric:: DELETE

Resets LedFx's config to default values and restarts.

*Warning* This will irreversibly delete all your devices, settings, etc.

/api/log
=========================

LedFx Logging

.. rubric:: GET

Opens a websocket connection through which realtime LedFx logging info will be sent.

/api/schema/
=========================

LedFx Schema Api

.. rubric:: GET /api/schema/

Get JSON schemas specifically defining the kind of data LedFx's API expects.
A GET with no request body will return all of LedFx's schemas
LedFx uses schemas to validate the following:

- *devices*
- *effects*
- *integrations*
- *virtuals*
- *audio*
- *melbanks*
- *wled_preferences*
- *core*

Like with the /api/config endpoint, you may instead ask for spefific schemas

example: Get LedFx audio schema

.. code-block:: json

    "audio"

example: Get LedFx devices and effects schema

.. code-block:: json

    ["devices", "effects"]

/api/schema/<schema_type>
============================

Query a specific LedFx schema with the matching *schema_type* as JSON

.. rubric:: GET /api/schema/<schema_type>

Returns the LedFx schema with the matching *schema_type* as JSON

- *devices*: Returns all the devices registered with LedFx

- *effects*: Returns all the valid schemas for an LedFx effect

- *integrations*: Returns all the integrations registered with LedFx

/api/devices
=========================

Query and manage devices connected to LedFx

.. rubric:: GET

Get configuration of all devices

.. rubric:: POST

Adds a new device to LedFx based on the provided JSON configuration

/api/devices/<device_id>
=========================

Query and manage a specific device with the matching *device_id* as JSON

.. rubric:: GET

Returns information about the device

.. rubric:: PUT

Modifies the information pertaining to the device and returns the new device as JSON

.. rubric:: DELETE

Deletes a device with the matching *device_id*

/api/find_devices
=========================

Find and add all WLED devices on the LAN.

.. rubric:: POST

For unregisted WLED devices, reads config direct from WLED remote device
Will default the remote protocol to DDP, unless WLED device build is prior to DDP support, in which case it will default to UDP
If device name has not been over ridden in WLED itself, then name will be generated from WLED-<6 digits of MAC Address>
Additionally ledfx virtuals will be created for all virtuals defined on the WLED device itself

Returns success as this is only a trigger action, device registration is handled by the back end

/api/find_launchpad
=========================

.. rubric:: GET

Returns the name of the first Launchpad device discovered on the system

example:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "status": "success",
        "device": "Launchpad X"
    }

if no device is found will return an error

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "status": "error",
        "error": "Failed to find launchpad"
    }

/api/find_openrgb/?server=1.2.3.4&port=5678
===========================================

.. rubric:: GET

Optional Query parameters are supported as follows:

'**server**' (optional): IP address of openRGB server, a default value of loacl host will be used
'**port**' (optional): Port to be used for openRGB server. a default value of 6742 will be used

In most cases these do not need to be defined as defaults of localhost and 6742 are used

Returns all found openRGB devices registered with the openRGB server

example:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "status": "success",
        "devices": [
            {
                "name": "ASRock Z370 Gaming K6",
                "type": 0,
                "id": 0,
                "leds": 1
            },
            {
                "name": "ASUS ROG STRIX 3080 O10G V2 WHITE",
                "type": 2,
                "id": 1,
                "leds": 22

example:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "status": "success",
        "devices": []
    }

if the openRGB server is not found an error will be returned

example:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "status": "error",
        "error": "timed out"
    }

/api/effects
=========================

.. rubric:: GET

Returns all the effects currently created in LedFx as JSON

.. rubric:: POST (upcoming)

Create a new Effect based on the provided JSON configuration

/api/effects/<effect_id>
=========================

Query and manage a specific effect with the matching *effect_id* as JSON

.. rubric:: GET

Returns information about the effect

.. rubric:: PUT (upcoming)

Modifies the configuration of the effect and returns the new configuration as JSON

.. rubric:: DELETE (upcoming)

Deletes the effect with the matching *effect_id*.

/api/virtuals
=========================

Query and manage virtuals connected to LedFx

.. rubric:: GET

Get configuration of all virtuals

.. rubric:: POST

Adds a new virtual to LedFx based on the provided JSON configuration

/api/virtuals/<virtual_id>
==========================

Query and manage a specific virtual with the matching *virtual_id* as JSON

.. rubric:: GET

Returns information about the virtual

.. rubric:: PUT

Set a virtual to active or inactive. Must evaluate to True or False with python's bool() (eg, true, 1, ..)

example:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "active": false
    }

.. rubric:: POST

Update a virtual's segments configuration. Format is a list of lists in segment order.

[[id, start, end, invert], ...]

id: valid device id
start: first pixel on the device for this segment
end: last pixel on the device for this segment (inclusive)
invert: invert this segment when it is mapped onto the device

example:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "segments": [
          ["my_device", 0, 49, false],
          ["my_other_device", 0, 99, false],
          ["my_device", 50, 99, false]
      ]
    }

This would end up with a virtual appearing on the devices as so:

.. code-block::

 [---first 50px of effect---][---last 50px of effect---] [---------------middle 100px of effect----------------]
 [-------------------my_device (100px)-----------------] [---------------my_other_device (100px)---------------]

another example:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "segments": [
          ["my_device", 0, 9, false],
          ["my_device", 20, 79, false],
          ["my_device", 90, 99, false]
      ]
    }

This would end up with a virtual appearing on the devices as so:

.. code-block::

 [ 10px ]    [------ 60px of effect ------]     [ 10px ]
 [-------------------my_device (100px)-----------------]
