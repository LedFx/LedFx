# Govee Device

Ledfx has now added support for Govee LAN enabled devices that are Razer
/ Dreamview compatible.

Ledfx has only limited access to examples, so if you find a device that
should be supported by is not, please raise in discord [Help and
Support](https://discord.gg/h3Atx4mkCh)

At the time of writing compatible Govee products were listed at this
link under the [Supports Razer/Dreamview
tab](https://desktop.govee.com/razer/devices)

It is not known exhaustively, which of these are truly functional
against ledfx current integration.

**Be aware:** An active session from LedFx towards a Govee device may
prevent the Govee Desktop app from opening correctly, it may appear
within Task manager but no substantiate its UI window. Stop LedFx, close
Govee Desktop from within Task Manager, and relaunch Govee Desktop.

## Known working examples

### Standard Lights

Known working with **Stretch To Fit** set to off

-   H6061 Glide Hexa Light Panels
-   H6167 Govee TV Backlight For 40-50 inch TVs
-   H61BA Govee RGBICW LED Strip Light 16.4 ft
-   H61D5 Neon Rope Light 2 16.4 FT
-   H615C RGB LED Strip Light 50 FT
-   TBD: add more here on discovery...

### Matrix Govee - AVOID

There is currently no good story around Govee matrix lights such as
curtains.

The majority of Govee effects appear to be driven local to the
controller, not via the LAN interface.

Even Govee Desktop app and Razer Chroma where supported is very limited.

Currently investigated matrix lights include:

| Device | Description      | LEDs | Govee Seg | Chroma Seg | Notes                              |
|--------|------------------|------|----------------|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| H70B1  | Curtain Lights   | 520  | 6         | 4          | Max 20 as per vertical drops       |
| H6811  | Net Lights       | 480  | NA        | NA         | Only first 224 pixels @82 seg      |
| TBD    | Add more here... | TBD  | TBD       | TBD        | TBD                                |

#### H70B1 Curtain Lights 520

DO NOT PURCHASE FOR LEDFX - No Matrix support

Reasonable 1d effects, one segment per vertical drop for a total of 20

Ceases to work about 20

#### H6811 Net Lights 480

STRONGLY NOT RECOMMENDED FOR USE WITH LEDFX - Considered incompatible

No apparent effect from the strech bit, all colors sent are stretched
across the first 224 pixels using a correct header. No apparent way to
use the last 256 pixels.

82 is the max pixel value to use before pixel stretching to 224 breaks
down.

Not supported by Govee app or Razer Chroma for any LAN relevant effects.

Power supply 5V 5A Raintight

Pin out from controller, button face up, noting there is no specific marking on the individual wires

## Govee Device Configuration

By default compatible Govee devices are not enabled for LAN control.

This must be enabled in the Govee app for both Wifi access and LAN api
control.

Find the specific device instance in the Govee app and hit the setting
Icon in the top right corner.

![Device page](/_static/devices/govee/settings.jpg)

Ensure that the wifi settings are correctly configured for you wifi
network name and password. The device must be ON and connected to the
app by bluetooth to achieve this the first time.

Then throw the LAN Control swith to on.

![Wifi Settings and LAN switch](/_static/devices/govee/LAN_switch.jpg)

While in this page, if you haven't already, take note of the device MAC
address and ensure it is reserved in your router DHCP settings to a
fixed IP address.

![Note the MAC from here](/_static/devices/govee/MAC.jpg)

You also need the device segment count from the Light Panel Layout page,
which is under Layout and Calibration. In this example the segment count
which you will use in the pixel count field in ledfx is 10.

## Ledfx Device Configuration

Ledfx does not currently support auto discovery for Govee.

Devices should be on a fixed IP addess through DHCP reservation against
the Govee device MAC address via your router configuration.

Via the Add Device button in the Ledfx UI, select Govee.

Input your desired device name in the Name field.

Input number of segments as seen in the Govee app in the Pixels Count
field.

Input the IP address of the device in the IP Address field.

Currently the default refresh rate is set to 40 on govee devices. This
is from very limited testing, users are encouraged to test and provide
feedback on the optimal refresh rate for their devices.

![Adding a device](/_static/devices/govee/add_govee.png)

Hit add and, your Govee device should now be available in the devices
view.

## Connection refresh

If Ignore Status is set to the default Off, If Govee device does not
respond to a device status enquirey at ledfx startup, it will be marked
offline.

If the device is powered on, or otherwise made available after startup,
pressing the refresh button on the device will attempt to reconnect to
the Govee device.

![Refesh connection](/_static/devices/govee/refresh.png)

If you have firewall issues blocking Port 4002 the status check can be
disabled by setting Ignore Status to On. Ledfx will assume that the
devices is available.
